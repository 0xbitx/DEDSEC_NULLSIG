<h1 align="center">DEDSEC_NULLSIG</h1>
<h4 align="center">NullSig transforms Metasploit Linux payloads into undetectable binaries using signature removal, encryption, and AV evasion tactics.</h4>

## DESCRIPTION
NullSig is a powerful payload transformation that takes standard Metasploit Linux payloads and converts them into highly evasive, undetectable binaries. It achieves this by removing known static signatures, applying strong encryption techniques, modifying the executable structure, and incorporating advanced anti-virus evasion tactics. NullSig not only disrupts traditional detection methods but also enhances payload stealth by introducing randomized obfuscation and in-memory execution strategies, making it a critical tool for red team operations, penetration testing, and advanced security research.

## FEATURES
  * Signature removal
  * Full encryption
  * In-memory execution
  * Anti-forensics techniques
  * Broken ELF header manipulation
  * Unique randomized stub for each payload
  * Process name spoofing to mimic legitimate system processes

## INSTALLATION 
    * git clone https://github.com/0xbitx/DEDSEC_NULLSIG.git
    * cd DEDSEC_NULLSIG
    * chmod +x dedsec_nullsig
    * sudo ./dedsec_nullsig

### TESTED ON FOLLOWING
* Kali Linux 
* Parrot OS
